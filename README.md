# Sneaker Tycoon

## Start your Reselling Business

*Sneaker Tycoon* is a clicker tycoon game in which you resell shoes in order to earn money to **upgrade your reselling
business.** Click to earn money, buy and sell shoes for profit, and watch your wealth grow!

You can spend your money on:
- buying and selling even more sneakers
- buying special sneakers for **powerful bonuses**
- upgrading your clicking power to earn money faster

Your final goal is to earn $1,000,000 so that you can expand your business and open a physical store!

This game is for all audiences, but is most appealing to people who are looking to play something casually to pass 
the time, and people who like sneakers and want to simulate a reselling business without spending real money and
taking real risks. 

I chose this project because I love sneakers and I love playing games, so I wanted to create something that combines 
these passions. Growing up, I loved playing games like Roller Coaster Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon, and Game Dev Story. Sneaker
Tycoon takes inspiration from these games, and features some of the community's most loved sneakers across 
generations.

  - OR apply the Observer design pattern, which is probably better
